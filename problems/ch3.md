**1\.** Find integral solutions or show there is none

- $3x + 4y = 10$

    Consider $3x + 4y = 1 \implies (-1, 1)$

    Thus $(-10, 10)$ is a solution. General solution is $(-10 + 4t, 10 - 3t)$

- $5x - 7y = 9$

    Consider $5x - 7y = 1 \implies (-4, -3)$

    Thus $(-36, - 27)$ is a solution. General solution is $(-36 -7t, -27 - 5t)$

- $4x + 6y = 11$

  No solution because $\gcd(4, 6) \nmid 11$

**5\.** A farmer pays $1770$ crowns for horses and oxen. He pays $31$ crowns for each horse and $21$ for each ex. How many horses and oxen did he buy?

$31x + 21y = 1770$

Consider $31x + 21y = 1$

\begin{align*}
31 &= 1 * 21 + 10 \\
21 &= 2*10 + 1 \\
10 &= 10 * 1 \\
\\
31 &= 1*31 + 0 * 21\\
21 &= 0*31 + 1*21 \\
10 &= 1*31 - 1*21\\
1 &= 1*21 - 2*10 = -2*31 + 3*21
\end{align*}

Thus $31(-2) + 21(3) = 1 \implies$ solution to the original equation is $(-3540 + 21t, 5310 - 31t)$

Considering only positive solutions, we get that $(9, 71)$ works. Thus the farmer bought $9$ horses and $71$ oxen
